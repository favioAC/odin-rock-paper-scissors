# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is the first JavaScript project in The Odin Project.  For this project, I had to make a Rock, Paper, or Scissors game that ran only in the browser console.  This project can be found on https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors#project-solution.

I used only information covered thus far in the course, which does no include for/while loops.  Instead, I created function that randomized the computer's selection, allowed the user to enter their selection, play different rounds, and determine who the winner is after 5 rounds are played.
